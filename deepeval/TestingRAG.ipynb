    "## What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**RAG** is a method that imprves the Large Language Models (LLMs) by combining them with external knowledge. RAG allows the model to access and use up-to-date, specific information from external data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use RAG:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use RAG for example to add a content of the classes to allow students ask questions, or for ecoomerce to include the info of your products.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Private/Proprietary Data**: When you need to query company documents, internal knowledge bases\n",
    "- **Up-to-date Information**: When the LLM's training data is outdated\n",
    "- **Domain-Specific Knowledge**: For specialized fields not well-represented in training data\n",
    "- **Reducing Hallucinations**: By grounding responses in actual documents\n",
    "- **Cost Efficiency**: Cheaper than fine-tuning for many use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components of RAG:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document Store**: A collection of documents containing the knowledge you want to query can be a document, code repo\n",
    "2. **Embeddings**: Vector representations of text chunks that capture semantic meaning\n",
    "3. **Vector Store**: A database that stores embeddings and enables similarity search\n",
    "4. **Retriever**: Finds the most relevant documents based on the query\n",
    "5. **Generator**: The LLM that generates answers using retrieved context\n",
    "\n",
    "### How RAG Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The info added to the LLM is break down into chunks and converted to vector\n",
    "2. The vectors are stored in a database \n",
    "3. The user submits a prompt\n",
    "5. The system tranforms into a numerical format (vector)\n",
    "5. Use the vector to search into the knowledge base \n",
    "6. The info is passed to the language model\n",
    "7. The answer is returned"

    "## RAG Application Example\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example the RAG will add some info abotu MCP (Model Context Protocol) and after we can check that the correct answer and context it's returned\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loads data** from the website https://www.descope.com/learn/post/mcp\n",
    "2. **Chunks the text** into smaller, manageable chunks\n",
    "3. **Creates embeddings** a embedding is the numerical vector representation of the text that caputre the semantic meaning and stores them in a vector database\n",
    "4. **Retrieves relevant chunks** when answering questions\n",
    "5. **Generates answers** using the retrieved context\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows us to answer questions about MCP even though the base LLM might not have been trained on this specific information."

    "- **LangSmith API Key**: Optional, but recommended for debugging and tracing\n",
